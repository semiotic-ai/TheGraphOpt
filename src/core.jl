    minimize(f::Function, a::OptAlgorithm)

Minimize `f` using `a`.

This will generally be less performant than [`TheGraphOpt.minimize!`](@ref).
However, there are cases in which this will be better, so we provide it as an option.

Minimize `f` using `a`.

Does in-place updates of `a.x`.
This will generally be more performant than [`TheGraphOpt.minimize`](@ref).
However, there are cases in which this will be worse, so we provide both.

Minimize `f` using `a`, which calls `op` for updating `a.x`.
